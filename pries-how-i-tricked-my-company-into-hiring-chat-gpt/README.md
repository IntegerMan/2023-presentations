## Abstract

In a form of chaotic good, I had my company hire "Chet Gupta" aka Chat GPT.  A model software engineer with a fantastic resume and perfect answers, that doesn't exist.  In this this talk we will walk through the circumstances that allowed for this to happen.  The kinds of answers that "Chet Gupta" produced for both the technical screening process as well as the competency based interview.  We'll examine the ethical and practical considerations raised by the use of AI technology in the hiring process and the subsequent need for revised them. By the end of the session attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the implications of AI in building a talent workforce.
