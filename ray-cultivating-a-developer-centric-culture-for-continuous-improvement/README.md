## Bio

Debo is a 3x startup founder and former staff engineer at Uber, where he oversaw critical security projects across infrastructure and product development. At every turn, Debo was confronted with two incompatible truths: 1) engineers lose a lot of precious time to inefficient tools and maintenance, and 2) organizations expect engineers to ship quickly. DevZero was created to reconcile this gap.
