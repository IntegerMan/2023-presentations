## Abstract

Believe it or not, there was a time before Git! And even longer ago there was a time before version control itself! Come learn all about the version control systems of yesteryear, such as SCSS and RCS. Stick around to learn the horrors of file locking and versioning. Gaze into the madness that is Darcs patch theory. Escape with a broad grasp on the history of version control, different paradigms, and how we all ended up using Git today. Then we'll attempt to gaze deep into our crystal ball to envision possible version control futures.
