## Abstract

We live in a world where it’s easy to be overstimulated and distracted. The more virtual our world becomes, the harder it is to focus, communicate, and complete tasks. This is especially challenging for people with neurodiversities such as ADHD, Autism, and Dyslexia, and those that support them. The tech industry has a higher than average neurodiverse population, creating a unique set of time management and communication challenges. In this session, you’ll learn what it means to be neurodiverse and how it affects people at work. Based on scientific research and firsthand experience, we’ll discuss methods for maximizing productivity and focus. You’ll also learn how to communicate more effectively when everything feels overwhelming so you can get the support you need. While the focus is on neurodiversity, this session is designed for anyone who needs help navigating our increasingly distracting world. By the time you leave, you’ll have tools and techniques you can use to be more productive and less stressed - yes, that’s possible!
