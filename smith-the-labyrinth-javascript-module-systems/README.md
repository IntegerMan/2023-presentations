## Bio

Jared Smith is a developer with 10 years experience working mostly with web applications and intelligent transportation systems (ITS) but has also dabbled in hardware emulation, Linux programming, and WebAssembly. These days he's slinging Typescript for the Web Platform team at Kroger. When not writing code or playing video games he's usually on a boat, at the beach, or hiking with his two daughters.

## Abstract

The twisty history of the Javascript programming language has birthed not one, not two, but over half-a-dozen distinct module systems still in use today with lots of idiosyncrasies and subtle incompatibilities between them. This talk will cover how we got here, and what we can do about now it as poor web developers just trying to ship our apps.
