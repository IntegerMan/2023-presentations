## Bio

I am a recovering chemist/virologist/microbiologist/physiologist with a penchant for research. Once I got married I decided the starving scientist gig, while awesome, wasn't really conducive to raising the considerably sized family I'd like to have (one wife, 6 kids, 1 goat and 26 chickens).

And so it was that through prayer, persistence and a lot of reading I pivoted into the role of a Web Developer. Then one day a manager asked me to write C++ and somehow I became a Software Engineer+DevOps Engineer+Software Development Engineer in Test chimera. 

Now I'm back in Front-End land using all that accumulated knowledge.

## Abstract

Eventually all developers end up here - the legacy codebase. Its one we didn't write ourselves and have no context on why decisions were made there but need to get up to speed with.

This talk will share the techniques I've used across multiple legacy codebases that have helped me get familiar with them as a new developer.

We'll talk about familiarizing yourself by using all available resources, including documentation, other developers, git history and yes, even confluence.

We'll round out the talk with suggestions on bringing about improvements to the legacy code after you've started understanding what's happening there. And finally, we tackle the ever-present issue that is technical debt in legacy codebases, and how to pay it off incrementally.
