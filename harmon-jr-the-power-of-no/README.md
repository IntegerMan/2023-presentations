## Abstract

Have you ever attended a meeting that you wish you hadn’t? Have you ever been happy that plans were canceled because you never really wanted to go in the first place? 

Saying no is hard and can be truly challenging when faced with the prospect of feeling like maybe you’ll let someone down. Another reason saying no is hard is the feeling or FOMO, or the Fear Of Missing Out. But are those reason really worth our peace of mind?

This talk is about how knowing when to say no and how to do so.
